Frequently Asked Questions

Does pyspider Work with Windows?
--------------------------------
Yes, it should, some users have made it work on Windows. But as I don't have windows development environment, I cannot test. Only some tips for users who want to use pyspider on Windows:

- Some package needs binary libs (e.g. pycurl, lxml), that maybe you cannot install it from pip, Windowns binaries packages could be found in [http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/).
- Make a clean environment with [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
- Try 32bit version of Python, especially your are facing crash issue.
- Avoid using Python 3.4.1 ([#194](https://github.com/binux/pyspider/issues/194), [#217](https://github.com/binux/pyspider/issues/217))

Unreadable Code (乱码) Returned from Phantomjs
---------------------------------------------

Phantomjs doesn't support gzip, don't set `Accept-Encoding` header with `gzip`.


How to Delete a Project?
------------------------

set `group` to `delete` and `status` to `STOP` then wait 24 hours. You can change the time before a project deleted via `scheduler.DELETE_TIME`.

How to Restart a Project?
-------------------------
#### Why
It happens after you modified a script, and wants to crawl everything again with new strategy. But as the [age](/apis/self.crawl/#age) of urls are not expired. Scheduler will discard all of the new requests.

#### Solution
1. Create a new project.
2. Using a [itag](/apis/self.crawl/#itag) within `Handler.crawl_config` to specify the version of your script.

How to Use WebDAV Mode?
-----------------------
Mount `http://hostname/dav/` to your filesystem, edit or create scripts with your favourite editor.

> OSX: `mount_webdav http://hostname/dav/ /Volumes/dav`  
> Linux: Install davfs2, `mount.davfs http://hostname/dav/ /mnt/dav`  
> VIM: `vim http://hostname/dav/script_name.py`

When you are editing script without WebUI, you need to change it to `WebDAV Mode` while debugging. After you saved script in editor, WebUI can load and use latest script to debug your code.

What does the progress bar mean on the dashboard?
-------------------------------------------------
When mouse move onto the progress bar, you can see the explaintions.

For 5m, 1h, 1d the number are the events triggered in 5m, 1h, 1d. For all progress bar, they are the number of total tasks in correspond status.

Only the tasks in DEBUG/RUNNING status will show the progress.

How many scheduler/fetcher/processor/result_worker do I need? or pyspider stop working
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can have only have one scheduler, and multiple fetcher/processor/result_worker depends on the bottleneck. You can use the queue status on dashboard to view the bottleneck of the system:

![run one step](imgs/queue_status.png)

For example, the number between scheduler and fetcher indicate the queue size of scheduler to fetchers, when it's hitting 100 (default maximum queue size), fetcher might crashed, or you should considered adding more fetchers.

The number `0+0` below fetcher indicate the queue size of new tasks and status packs between processors and scheduler. You can put your mouse over the numbers to see the tips.
